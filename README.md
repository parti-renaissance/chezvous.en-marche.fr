## Static Templates

There are two types of templates compiled with the app:
- `app/components/summary/summary-templates.js`
- `app/components/map/filter-templates.js`

Both are a hashmap relating a key to a small set of data. `summary-templates` maps a `label` to be used a header for the summary, and a `template`, with placeholders in `{{ }}` curly brackets. `filter-templates` maps a marker `type` to a `color` and a `label`. The `label` is displayed in a user control, and the `color` name is used to color corresponding map markers and the user control as well.

## Adding new Colors and Types

Simply follow the established data structures within the two template files to add either a new marker or summary type.

To associate a color with a marker type, two new CSS rules must be added: one for the filter control and one for the marker itself. These rules are driven by the value specified for the `color` key in the `filter-templates` file, so if you've got a filter type (for a map marker) defined like so:
```js
// app/components/map/filter-templates.js
export default {
  ...
  new_fiber_optics: {
    label: "New Fiber Optics (but in French)",
    color: "seafoam",
  },
  ...
};
```

Then you'd be using the value `seafoam` to add the CSS rules. Both rules should be added to `app/styles/components/_map.scss`. We're making use of the CSS variable `currentColor` in both cases, which is why we set the `color` style.

To add a a css rule for the input itself, find the `.map-filter` rule block, and add a nested selector for the color, like so:
```sass
// app/styles/components/_map.scss
.map-filter {
  ...

  &.seafoam .map-filter__input:checked {
    color: // whatever color seafoam is
  }
}
```

This will make the `new_fiber_optics` filter control have a background of whatever value you put in there.

To add a css rule for the marker, add a `.color--seafoam` rule that specifies the `color` value. There are a set of existing color rules at the bottom of `app/styles/components/_map.scss`.
```sass
// app/styles/components/_map.scss
.color--seafoam {
  color: // whatever color seafoam is
}
```
